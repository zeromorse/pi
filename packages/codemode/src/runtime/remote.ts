/**
 * Runs the VM in another isolate, reached over an RPC boundary such as a Cloudflare Durable Object
 * stub, while tools keep running in the caller.
 *
 * Problem: a VM on the calling thread blocks that thread while the script computes. In a Durable
 * Object that serves an agent session, a CPU-heavy script would stall every other request to the
 * session (including the user's abort) for seconds. Measured on Cloudflare (October 2026), a
 * script that computed for 10 seconds delayed the session's other requests by 10 seconds when it
 * ran in the session object or in a Dynamic Worker, but by about 50 ms when it ran in a Durable
 * Object of a separately deployed Worker.
 *
 * Solution: the caller keeps the host role (`RemoteCodemodeSandbox`: tools, call records,
 * deadline, abort) and the remote side only runs the VM (`serveCodemodeRemote`, behind
 * `CodemodeSandboxDurableObject` in `@earendil-works/pi-codemode/cloudflare`).
 *
 * Protocol, one RPC call per execution:
 *
 *     client                                     remote
 *     remote.execute(request, exchange) ───────▶ starts the VM (in-thread, with interrupt budget)
 *                                      ◀─────── exchange([...outputs, call])   one call per tool call
 *     runs the tool, replies with result ──────▶ VM continues
 *                                      ◀─────── exchange([...outputs, done])   terminal, reply ignored
 *     execute() resolves ◀────────────────────── VM disposed
 *
 * `exchange` is a function the client passes in; over Workers RPC it becomes a stub that calls back
 * into the client. Output is buffered on the remote side and sent with the next call or the
 * terminal message, so a script that prints in a loop does not make one RPC per line. Each
 * `exchange` carries at most one call, so concurrent tool calls are concurrent RPCs. Calls on one
 * stub are delivered in order, which keeps output ordered before the call or result that follows.
 *
 * Termination: the client cannot interrupt a remote VM that is computing. When the client finishes
 * first (deadline, abort, `close()`), it answers every pending and later `exchange` with
 * `{ type: "stop" }`, and the remote stops the VM at that point. A script that computes without
 * calling a tool runs until its interrupt budget is used up. The remote reports that as a
 * `failure` message, which the client turns into the same `kind: "timeout"` error an in-thread
 * VM produces.
 *
 * Failure: if the RPC call rejects (the remote isolate crashed, hit its CPU limit, or was
 * redeployed) or returns without a terminal message, the execution fails with `kind: "sandbox"`.
