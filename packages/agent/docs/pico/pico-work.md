# pico implementation plan

Clean room. Nothing from pico2 is copied; its tests are read for the bugs they caught (a failed
generation that never ended its run, refs inside task patches, a collapse deadlocking appends,
quiescence firing during a retry wait, watch dropping late deltas) so that packages 6, 9, 12 and
16 each carry a case for them.

Bottom up. Each package is a module with its own tests and no forward references; the suite is
green after every one. The reference for every detail is `pico-v3.md`; `pico-usage-guide.md`
shows the surface each package has to end up with.

## 1. Types and ids

`Id`, `EntryIdentity`, `EntryBase`, the composable `EntryData` / `ModelProjection` /
`ContextHead` / `ContextEdits` facets, `Entry`, `EntryKind`, `EntryInput`, `ContextEdit`, `Task`,
`TaskRole`, stored task roles, `Conversation`, `InboxItem`, `InputResult`, `InboxOp`, acceptance
receipts, `Address`/`Value`/`List`/`Scope`, `Write`/`CommitBatch`, `Page`/`Cursor` and the query shapes
(§2, §4.1, §5.1, §7.2–7.3). No code.

Test: it compiles; fixtures cover entries with no data, no model, every individual facet and the
built-in facet combinations.

## 2. Memory storage

`Storage` and `MemoryStorage`: `commit` numbering from `lastSeq`, point reads, fork-aware
`scanEntries` / `scanTasks` / `scanConversations` with cursors, target-capped `newestHead` over stored
numeric boundaries, stored entry data/model/edits, value versions and list elements read at a
position, `ownedFrom`, the set of entry kind strings written.

Tests: every row of the §7.2 query table against hand-built batches; ids are `lastSeq + 1 + i`; a
head is found without a kind; entry headers omit arbitrary data but retain model/head/edits; a
live-task scan decodes no terminal rows; `remove` and `clear` hide by position.

## 3. The line and `Tx`

`commit(plan)` on a serialized line: buffered writes, ids final at call time, rewindable
conversation value/list writes after an entry throw, a throwing plan discards everything, publish
after persist, `kick` when a batch touched a task. Session and sticky conversation state, task
writes and conversation writes may appear anywhere. `task` / `patch` / `settle` materialize the role
from the kind's status map. `value` / `list` / `entry` / `task` / `patch` / `settle` build the batch
of §7.3.

Tests: concurrent commits serialize; a rejected commit consumes no ids; each builder verb produces
the expected write; reads inside a plan see committed state only; session and sticky conversation
writes may follow and reference a new entry; rewindable value set/delete and list
append/remove/clear after an entry each reject.

## 4. Entry kinds and context

`EntryKind` as `kind` plus `is`, the registry and typed append helpers for the built-in kinds
(`user`, `assistant`, `tool_result`, `system`, `notice`, `summary`, `handoff`, `reset`). Writers
materialize optional model messages and stored controls; context = newest stored head prepended to
the fork-aware range from its numeric boundary, older heads excluded, stored edits folded in
transcript order, stored model arrays concatenated, then pi-ai tool results ordered by call index.
The `system` data fold selects the newest baseline plus later deltas and places their stored messages
in the baseline slot / `SystemMessage`s. There is no read-time entry-kind behavior.

Tests: data-only and model-only entries; summary keeps the tail; handoff/reset normalize `"self"`;
repeated compaction subsumes; a stored head below the previous visible boundary is rejected; edits
omit/replace targets and persist across turns; context is identical with its plugin kind unregistered;
the fold on a context that kept an old delta; tool-result order.

## 5. Forks and historical reads

`createConversation` with `parent`, the shared prefix in fork-aware `scanEntries`, capped-source
lookup for values and lists, arbitrary transcript-entry fork points.

Tests: a fork sees the head, edits and values in force at its entry; heads/results the source adds
later are invisible; deep fork chains; successful incomplete tool exchanges project with missing
results but inherit no tasks; state committed after the entry (a model change) is not in the fork.

## 6. Task kinds and the driver

`TaskKind`, the registry, kind-declared status cycles, `TaskContext` (`commit`, `scratch`, `sleep`,
`signal`, `config`, `hooks`), the driver of §6.1 (`owned`, `Wake`, attached scopes, `drive` as a
waiter, unchanged-status and poison guards, abort join and re-read), scopes of §6.2. Test kinds only:
a counter, a blocker, a cycling schedule, a kind that returns without changing status, a kind that
ignores its signal. There is no parked role or successor chain for retries.

Tests: persisted roles select execute / recover without a role-map lookup; a blocked execute holds
nothing up; a valid status cycle; the exact unchanged-status guard; `after` gates a start;
conversation and harness drive both start foreground/background work, resolve on foreground idle
and keep serving background work; a full-quiescence wait remains pending on a recurring schedule;
abort marks in both race orders; reopen recovers inflight; a mark written by one process is applied
by the next.

## 7. Scratch

Scratch batches, one task per batch, `ScratchTx`, retire on settle, sidecar-independent (memory).

Tests: a crash before settle keeps scratch; settle deletes it; a write after settle is rejected; a
new attempt clears its list.

## 8. Harness shell and handles

`Harness.open` (built-in registries, `kinds` and `replace` options, kinds-set check, `inspect`,
`drive`, `close`, `shutdown`), `ConversationHandle` (`commit`, `value` / `list`, `config` /
`settings`, `fork` with `abort`, `abort`, `hooks.on` scoped with `subtree`), `acceptance(requestId)`,
`result(inputId)`, `abortTask`, `conversations` with `parent` / independent filtering. No agent
behaviour yet.

Tests: open on empty vs existing storage; an unregistered entry kind is reported without scanning
entries and its stored model/head/edits still derive context; an unknown live task kind rejects;
replace by name keeps `h.kinds.<name>` consistent; `settings` round-trips; scoped hooks run after
harness-wide ones, innermost last.

## 9. Generation kind

One stable generation task carries `inputs: Id[]` and cycles pending → streaming → retry_wait /
deferred → streaming until done / failed / aborted on a faux provider; explicit terminal results for
its whole input group; config capture (model, thinking, selected tools, profile, budget);
`system_instructions` with
sections merged across handlers and the diff writing `system` data plus its materialized model
message; `before_request`,
`after_response`, `on_yield`; retry sleeps in execute; recover from frames; usage recorded per
attempt.

Tests: the six system-entry traces from the guide (tool added, removed, host section changed, MCP
schema changed, plugin section on and off, `addTools`); fresh baseline after a head; a fork diffs
against its own config; a restart emits only the changed section; in-band `aborted` stop reason;
crash while streaming publishes the partial; retry budget exhausted → failed with no successor.

## 10. Tools, post_tools, exchanges

The tool kind with the sink (`ToolOutput`, `ToolOutputState`, limits enforced by the sink, `diag`,
`delegate`, `handoff`, `addTools`, `terminate`), tool-result entries with structured data plus their
materialized model message, `before_tool` (fail-closed) and `after_tool`,
replay policy on recover; post_tools with `after`, carried input groups, terminate / handoff / steer /
next generation; `accept` idle vs busy; `prompt`, `result` and request acceptance lookup.

Tests: parallel tools completing in either order; sequential via `after`; an aborted generation
creates no tool tasks/results while an aborted existing tool writes its own error result;
`new_context` resets after the exchange, never inside it; `addTools` writes the rewindable loadout
before any handoff/user entry in the settlement commit and appears in the next turn's `toolsAdded`;
a throwing tool → error result, `terminate` still honoured; truncation diag from the sink; a lost
accept response is recovered through `acceptance(requestId)`; a duplicate create reports the first
receipt; results remain point-readable after further turns.

## 11. Inbox

`pi.inbox` as a conversation sticky list whose element id is `inputId` and whose value holds mode,
complete entry draft and optional request id; append/remove/clear watch operations; queued/running
and terminal result values; the three placement points; carried generation/post_tools input groups;
`cancelQueued`; abort draining steer and followUp while preserving write and nextRun.

Tests: idle append/remove is one commit and emits no inbox event; busy image payload is one append
operation; the modes table; steer joins at post_tools but starts a group after a final answer;
followUp starts the next group; nextRun waits for idle accept; writes are placed without joining;
several inputs resolve to one answer; cancel/land and abort/group-transfer in both orders; queued and
placed crash recovery; cancelled unplaced payload is unavailable; input queued during collapse lands.

## 12. Collapse

Manual, threshold and overflow; `before_collapse`; publish only if no newer head; the overflow
chain (generation settles → collapse → new generation carrying the attempt).

Tests: a summary lands under a running generation and later entries stay in context; a competing
head makes a summary stale while intervening edits do not; overflow retries once and no live task
ever waits on the collapse; threshold before a turn; abort of a running collapse leaves appends
flowing.

## 13. Subagents

The `subagent` tool (`run`, `spawn`, `send`, `status`, `wait`, `stop`), ownership links, foreground
reach through live owners, `run`'s recover driving the child again, `spawn` initialization of config,
explicit child input results.

Tests: restart in the middle of `run`; parent abort reaches a `run` child and spares a `spawn`
child; `stop`; nested children; the child's first turn writes its own baseline.

## 14. Jobs and the budget

`jobKind` on `ExecutionEnv.exec` with output into its scratch, `waitForTask` / `jobOutput`, `bash`
delegating first and waiting with the budget, `notify` and the `notice` entry, the `job` tool,
schedules.

Tests: budget expiry settles the call with `delegated` and the job continues; the notice appears
on completion; a schedule cycles one stable task id and `abortTask` ends it; it does not block
ordinary harness drive after foreground idle; recover → `lost` or rerun by policy; a user abort
during the wait kills a non-backgrounded job.

## 15. Previews

`ctx.preview` as a Chord tracker per task; the generation applies stream events to a partial
message, the tool's preview is its sink state, the job's the same; `preview.init` on attach and
reopen; flush after each scratch commit.

Tests: one token → one `a` op and nothing else; no `r` mid-stream; init after reopen yields a base
equal to the live preview; a sliding tool tail → `t` + `a`.

## 16. Watch

`ConversationView`, `ConversationEvent`, the exported kind-free `applyEvent`, `WatchHandle`
(capture on the line, bounded buffering, `resnapshot`, `unsubscribe`), the session watch with
`report` and `usage`, the usage ledger (`pi.usage` + totals).

Tests: the fold is correct (view after N events equals a fresh capture, randomized); head and edit
entries update derived context; inbox append/remove/clear operations update the view and same-commit
append/remove cancels; all events of one commit delivered together; a thin-client reducer over a
recorded stream with no kinds loaded;
lag → fault → resnapshot; `resnapshot` from inside the listener; usage totals equal the ledger
fold, failed and aborted attempts included.

## 17. JSONL storage

Append-only batches, replay on open, torn tail discarded, malformed line fails open, entry
`data`/`model`/`head`/`edits` and the kind-string set from replay, values as Chord deltas (full when
first or small, ops otherwise), scratch sidecars retired after the main-file settle.

Tests: conformance against memory (one mutation stream, identical query results); linear file
growth under repeated sets of a large value; accepted payload plus placement has two JSONL copies,
including idle acceptance; crash between the settle write and the sidecar unlink.

## 18. SQLite storage

Tables and indexes of §7.5, nullable entry JSON columns for data/model/edits and an indexed integer
head boundary, scratch rows deleted in the settle transaction, storage version and `migrate`.

Tests: conformance three ways; removed sticky inbox elements may be physically discarded while
input results remain point-readable; a cold reopen decodes only live rows (count them); a version
mismatch rejects.

## 19. Race matrix and telemetry

The §10.2 matrix in both orders with faux clocks, fake processes and storage barriers; spans per
task call and per commit.

Tests: the matrix; span tree for one turn with a tool and a retry.

## 20. Clients

mini (`worker/run.ts`, `worker/lane-service.ts`, TUI `apply(view)`), the experimental agent's four
seam files (`session-worker.ts`, `agent-controller-provider.ts`, `models-provider.ts`,
`transcript-provider.ts`), real providers. This is the gate: system deltas on a live model, a
retry, a spawned subagent surviving a restart, speculative compaction under a running turn.

Packages 1–16 are what the gate needs; 17–19 can land after it.

## What comes from the lane harness, and how

Clean room means no imports from `src/harness/runtime`, `session`, `agent-harness.ts` or the
`dom`/`pico`/`pico2` spikes. Where the old code has something worth keeping, it is **copied** into
`src/harness/pico/` and owned there; pico must build with the rest of `src/harness` deleted.

Copy (under `packages/agent/src/harness/` unless noted):

| what | from | into | package |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ExecutionEnv` / `FileSystem` / `Shell` types, the Node env, capture and spill | `types.ts`, `env/`, `tools/tool-context.ts` (03-execenv) | `pico/env/` | 10, 14 |
| shell output limits, `applyShellOutputUpdate`, truncation totals | `utils/` | `pico/env/output.ts` | 10 |
| the built-in tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `image`) | `tools/*.ts` | `pico/tools/`, rewritten to the sink signature | 10, 14 |
| system prompt builder, skills, context files, templates | `system-prompt.ts`, `skills.ts`, `prompt-templates.ts`; the keyed-sections builder in `coding-agent` | the host's `system_instructions` handler, not the harness | 9, 20 |
| telemetry span helpers | `telemetry.ts` | `pico/telemetry.ts` | 19 |

Depend on, as packages (they are not the old harness):

- `@earendil-works/chord/delta` (15, 16, 17)
- `@earendil-works/pi-ai`: `faux` provider for tests, `utils/estimate` for thresholds, `SystemMessage` (4, 9, 12)

Read before writing the equivalent, then close the file:

- `runtime/drive/retry.ts`, `deferred.ts`, `response.ts`: retryable-error classification, overflow detection, deferred polling (9)
- `compaction/`, `runtime/drive/boundary.ts`: the exchange-cut rule and the summarizer prompt (12)
- `runtime/drive/recovery.ts`, `restore.ts`: the per-phase recovery case list (9, 10, 14)
- `runtime/drive/tool-placement.ts`: the result order projection must reproduce (4)
- `hooks.ts`, `docs/harness.md` §before_tool: the exact decision shape (10)
- `session/`, `test/harness/jsonl-*.test.ts`: torn-tail and malformed-line rules (17)
- `session/`, `test/harness/mutation-line.test.ts`: line discipline edge cases (3)
- `agent-harness.ts`: `LaneSnapshot` / `HarnessEventPayload`, for the `toLaneSnapshot(view)` shim only (20)

Tests to port (`packages/agent/test/harness/`): the three conformance suites as the model for 17–18;
`compaction`, `branch`, `context`, `execution-*`, `values`, `mutation-line` as the parity source for
19; `system-prompt`, `prompt-templates` for the host handler in 9; `tools`, `truncate`,
`output-capture` for 10; pico v1's 27 ported scenarios as the shortest list of behaviours to
re-prove.

Do not read: `runtime/lane.ts`, `reducer.ts`, `drive/reconcile.ts`, `structural.ts`,
`terminal.ts`, `checkpoint.ts`, and the `dom` spike. They are the operation state machines and the
reconciler this design replaces.
